plot.py      :  Python plotting from Rafael
makePlot.py  :  Modified Rafael version by Geir Naevdal  (Not tested yet)
covid.ipynb  :  A jupyter notebook for plotting the model outputs.

# REQUIREMENTS

pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/)
matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/)

# USAGE:

- plot.py:

In a command line/prompt/shell, from the 'run' directory, run

python ..\python\enkf_seir\plot\plot.py

This will load the tecplot files located in the 'run' directory and save the figures for all available plots
(currently dead, hosp, case, susc, recov, infec, expos) in png format, dpi = 300.

For more options run 

python ..\python\enkf_seir\plot\plot.py -h

- makePlot.py:
In a command line/prompt/shell, from the 'run' directory, run

python ..\python\enkf_seir\plot\makePlot.py --data_dir .\ --figs_out_dir .\

This will load the tecplot files located in the 'run' directory and save the figures for all available plots
(currently dead, hosp, case, susc, recov, infec, expos) in png format, dpi = 1200.

NOTE: this script has the number of lines that must be read from the tecplot files.
Adjust the variables 'skipfooter' and 'header' according to your run.

# FOR MORE PLOTTING OPTIONS

The above scripts create plots following a fixed plot template for all the variables.
But you can create your own plot by reading the data from the tecplot files using
the teclplot_loader module. Pandas data frames can be manipulated to create any desired plot.
