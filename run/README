The corona.dat file contains 
"date"  "number of deaths" "Number of hospitalized" "Registred number of infected"
only the deaths and hospitalized columns are read and used in the conditioning.

The output files are all in the run dir, in a Tecplot format (for my plotting software.
I am waiting for someone to make outputs for pyplot and matlab. 

I am normally plotting data from 
case_1.dat  Number of cases
dead_1.dat  Number of dead
expos_1.dat Number of exposed
hosp_1.dat  Number of Hospitalized
infec_1.dat Number of infected
recov_1.dat Number of recovered
susc_1.dat  Number of susceptible                                      

The _1 means posterior _0 is prior 
and par0 and par1 contains prior and posterior ensembles of parameters.

The header of the files explains the content but it is normally
the "ensembler_ mean", " stdandard_dev" and all the ensemble members:
     "ave" "std" "  1" .....
If you delete the headers, any x y1 y2 ... plotting program would do the job.
